Imagine you are planning to travel to Chicago, but the public transports are booked. Also, you want to shop at your local grocery store, which takes an hour by bus. No worries! How about an application that shows all the people near your vicinity traveling to the same destination or running the same errand? That is where TagMeIn comes into the picture.

This project aims to create a platform where students (ride seekers) can find people (car owners) who are traveling to the same place (destination) where they want to go and carpool. Feel free to share your travel history with your friends and family, and do not hesitate to choose any of your favorite rides. TagMeIn can help students with their grocery shopping, traveling to major cities together for conferences, paper presentations, airport transfers, etc.
